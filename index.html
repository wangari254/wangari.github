            This pasta dish is probably the one that we both make most regularly. <br>It's so quick to throw together, tastes divine and uses lots of pantry essentials, so it's perfect for when you have very little in the fridge. <br> If you don't have fresh spinach, you can always add a few frozen vegies instead. The sauce is also lovely served on top of a roasted potato or sweet potato with a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.

        This recipe makes enough meatballs for two meals for a family of four, so you can serve half now and freeze the rest for another meal with a fresh batch of polenta. Admittedly, if you have hungry teenagers they may devour it in one meal!

        <strong>Step 1:</strong>Add the beef, pork, zucchini, mushrooms, onion, garlic, parsley, capers, ricotta, eggs and pepper to a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. Roll the mixture into balls about the size of a golf ball. <br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong>Preheat the oven to 180°C. <br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong>Heat the oil in a large ovenproof frying pan over medium heat. Gently fry the meatballs in several batches until browned all over, adding a little more oil to cook each batch if necessary.<br>
<strong>Step 4:</strong>Return all of the meatballs to the pan and pour in the tomato passata. Half-fill the passata jar with water and shake to loosen the remaining tomato, then pour into the pan. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven. Bake for 30–35 minutes or until the sauce is rich in colour. <br>
<strong>Step 5:</strong>After the meatballs have been cooking for 15 minutes, cook the polenta. Combine 4 cups (1 litre) water and the salt in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Slowly pour in the polenta while whisking to ensure there are no lumps. Simmer the polenta, stirring often, for 15 minutes. Stir in the grated parmesan and the oil.<br>
<strong>Step 6:</strong>Serve the polenta immediately, topped with the meatballs and basil leaves.

        This pancake crepe recipe has been in my family for as long as I can remember. It's been tweaked over the years from the original one my dad used to make, but this is the version that has stayed with me and that I can make in my sleep.
I've now taught it to my kids as well and they love it. Just don't be too fussy. Pancakes should be easy, joyful and quick. So you can eat them hot and enjoy every mouthful.

    <p>
        <strong>Step 1
        :</strong>Starting with the flour, place all your ingredients into a large mixing bowl, except for the extra milk.<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong>Whisk until most lumps are gone and the batter has come together. Then slowly add more milk until you have a nice thin consistency that will be easy to spread around the pan. You might need all the milk, or you might not. Find the consistency you like. I like it thin for nice thin crepes.<br> <strong>Step 3:</strong>Heat a shallow frypan to medium-high, melt a little butter in the pan, but don't burn it. If the pan is too hot, turn it down a little. When the butter is sizzling, drop a ladle-full of batter into the pan and tilt the pan to spread the batter out nice and thin.<br>
<strong>Step 4:</strong>Once the top of the crepe stops looking wet, flip your pancake over in the pan to cook the other side. Remove crepe to a plate and keep warm.<br>
<strong>Step 5:</strong>Repeat until all the batter is used up, and serve warm with maple syrup or your topping of choice.
